One example of a trusted brand is Airbnb, a web-based home rental service. It was founded in 2008, and over the past decade or so, it has expanded to become one of the most popular home-sharing platforms. They appeal to those who want to live like a local when they travel, and they usually result in immensely satisfying experiences. It's also a way to help those who live in more remote areas to make a little disposable income. 

Airbnb provides a unique experience for both travelers and hosts. Both parties get to meet exotic and unique personalities through this exchange, and they are also exposed to all kinds of cultures. Most worth noting is that Airbnb has managed to successfully create a network of trust, that is able to connect people from all over the world. 

They overthrow the "stranger equals danger" bias by building up a robust reputation. People leave abundant reviews and ratings, both for travelers and for hosts, so others may use them as helpful references and reliable sources. Reviews are always very honest, as both hosts and travelers can only see the others' reviews after writing up their own. In this way, Airbnb creates a very well-maintained and high-quality review system. 

More and more, start-ups are starting to rely on this peer-to-peer exchange approach in their services. In other words, people nowadays start to pay more attention to developing a collaborative economy, with Airbnb at the frontier of this social collaboration ecosystem. 

Another factor that contributes to Airbnb's growing success is their benevolent treatment of their employees. They offer a comprehensive set of perks and stipends for their employees, such as a $2,000 yearly allowance to let them visit any country where there is an Airbnb listing. The company also promotes an inspiring and friendly working environment, treating their employees as Airbnb's vital assets. All employees have a holistic support plan, allowing them to focus on their work without worrying too much about the trivial details in life. 

Unquestionably, Airbnb has been providing a service that positively impacts people's lives. With today's technological advancements, users can make a reservation directly from their mobile device, and immediately ask the host for travel advice. Airbnb has undoubtedly established a successful collaborative business model.
