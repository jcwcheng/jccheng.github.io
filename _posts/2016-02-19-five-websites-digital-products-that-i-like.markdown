**[Hello Monday](http://hellomonday.com/ "Hello Monday"){:target="_blank"}**
<br>
My eyes were pleased immensely by Hello Monday's brillint works. This site presents their talents perfectly, all the output of cross browsers are taken good care of. You can tell they considerately put lots of efforts on any deivces. I admire that they maneged precisely on the effects when the users hover their cursor around the canvas, the objects of background would transformm cleverly in a 3-dimensional way, all of the movements you interact with are flowing. Hello Monday's high quility of works on website performance optimization and visual design, which exhibits its not only a crafted but also a functional product.

<br>
Signes du Quotidien brings users a whole new way of interaction experience, from the first landing page to the other pages. The navigation has its own way to interact with their users apart from other sites. I relish that they took a shot at the new approach for website on humanâ€“computer interaction and pulled it off . It proves that they have innovative spirit and are able to being a creaive design agency. Their mobile version site didn't show what I expected to have, I enjoy receiving the new feel nonetheless.

<br>
I truly enjoy how Benjamin Guedj makes use of color, font, and imagery within his portfolio which feels together and connected. He took advantage of his sense of beauty in work, the layout served as a foil to the unique elegance of what he delivered. The colors present consistency and harmony throughout the site, you will notice each of his project has its own primary color and secondary color. However, all the well-designed elements for the whole of the site relatively compliment each other well makes me feel clean and simple.

<br>
Red Collar really showcases their aesthetic appeal sufficiently, all the visual components blend in well together. When I arrive at their landing page, my eyes were drawn to the subtleties of movement of the backgrounds. They pulled off all the transition effects, as you scroll down the page to a certain project section, you will notice that the title of each project slide in / out gradually but smoothly without any possible performance problems occur. That said, yes, they optimized both images and codes to as possibly minimum in size as they could be. The feature of the website I like the most is the timeline-like sidebar which guides users toward their destination efficiently, getting lost seems unlikely at this time.

<br>
The minimalist portfolio exhibits its temperament and meticulousness, which made by a France developer - Sylvain Reucherand. I appreciate that he employed neither more nor less properly effects in transition, feel comfortable browsing around with his work. The animated transitions just work ably professed. He well arranged utilizing the modular approach which makes me enjoy more in the extreme lightweight website.
