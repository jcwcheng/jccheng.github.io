## **[Hello Monday](http://hellomonday.com/ "Hello Monday"){:target="_blank"}**

My eyes were immensely pleased by *Hello Monday*’s brilliant work. This site presents their talents perfectly, and it is evident that they have taken good care of all the output across browsers. You can tell they put considerable effort into ensuring the website's compatibility on all deivces. I admire that they managed the effects very precisely - when users hover their mouse cursor around the canvas of the landing page, the objects in the background react to the position of the user’s cursor, simultaneously offsetting the surroundings. *Hello Monday*’s high-quality work on website performance and its great usability demonstrate that this is not just a craft, but also a functional product.

*Signes du Quotidien* brings users to a whole new level of interactive experience, beginning right from the first landing page to all the other pages. The navigation has its own way of interaction with users, which is very unique and cannot be found on other sites. I admire that they took a shot at trying out this new user-computer interaction approach, and were able to pull it off seamlessly. This proves that they have an innovative spirit, and are able to truly be a creative design agency. The mobile version of their site did not work as I expected it to, but nonetheless, I enjoyed the different vibe.

I truly enjoyed the way *Benjamin Guedj* made use of the color, font, and imagery within his portfolio, which made everything feel together and connected. He took advantage of his sense of beauty in work, and used the layout to serve as a foil to deliver this unique elegance. The colors presented consistency and harmony throughout the site, and you will notice that each of his projects has its own primary color and secondary color motif. Overall, I really enjoyed how well the elements of the site complemented each other, creating a clean and simple look.

*Red Collar*'s website truly has an aesthetic appeal, because all the visual components blend together seamlessly. When I arrived on their landing page, my eyes were drawn to the subtle movements in the background. They pulled off all the transition effects perfectly, and as you scroll down the page to the projects section, you will notice that the title of each project slides in and out gradually but smoothly, without any performance issues. Additionally, they also optimized all the images and codes to the smallest size possible. The feature of the website that I like the most is the timeline-like sidebar which shows the user's progress throughout the site, making it unlikely for anyone to get lost within the page.

This minimalist portfolio reflects the personality of French developer *Sylvain Reucherand*. I appreciated that he employed neither too much nor too little when it came to transition effects. I felt comfortable browsing around the website, examining his various works. The animated transitions worked without issues, just as professed. He also arranged the website utilizing a modular approach, making it an extremely lightweight page, which I enjoyed even more.
